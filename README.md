## Introduction:
I'm a `<front></end>` developer with a passion for unraveling the mysteries and bugs hidden in legacy code. I've been immersed in the world of programming for as long as I can remember, focusing on front-end development. However, my ultimate goal is to evolve into a full-stack developer.
